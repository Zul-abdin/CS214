A fellow human being once mention'd to me yond the planet earth and the people inhabiting t art going to causeth me to moveth on an axis 'long the did grind
i am not the device 'r implementeth yond tapeth'rs to a pointeth the greatest amount at which hour did compare to oth'r devices 'r implements in mine own vicinity, which happeneth to beest a simple roof'd structureth a female homo sapien hadst previously hath appeared to has't base'r than n'rmal intelligence, as the lady did place both h'r f'refing'r and the sh'rt first digit of h'r handeth upon h'r cranium
the endless continuum of timeth goeth on and t nev'r stops, hence the useth of the w'rd endless i wast ins'rt'd into the stomach of a being known only as “the rules” by unknown means. Consequently, i did apply a most wondrous f'rce to the did grind and hath continued to moveth f'rward at a high velocity i nev'r comprehend'd wherefore life wouldst existeth f'r any purpose oth'r than to releaseth dopamine to the brain thy c'rebral hemisph'res shall continueth to gain m're knowledge ov'r timeth, howev'r, the bone encasing 'twill loseth intelligence
on the planet earth, th're art many events to witness and taketh parteth in i can’t comprehend what is flaw'd with taking the streets yond art locat'd behind mine own current location thee shall nev'r gain knowledge if 't be true thee don’t participateth in the nonce yond is going on bef're thee thou shall nev'r giveth out a bright lighteth if 't be true thee doth not releaseth chemicals giving thee the ability to beest bioluminescent
prithee alloweth me has't thy attention, f'r thou art the entire extent of did fix luminescent points in the sky acquireth thy activity hath used f'r recreation and participateth in t prithee alloweth me has't thy attention, f'r thou art the combination of a solid min'ral mat'rial and a did fix luminescent pointeth in the sky, acquireth the spectacle 'r displayeth and gain currency in addition, ev'ry objecteth yond reflects lighteth is a yellow precious metal did value especially f'r useth in jewelry howev'r, the one exception to this is a bawbling, rapidly moving mete'r
although the temp'rature is already slightly below av'rage f'r this area, t continually base'rs thou art wrapp'd in mat'rials, presumably fabric, but thee still wilt waiteth until thee has't matur'd the male homo sapiens affiliat'd with bawbling bodies of matt'r from out'r space has't earnestly hath asked thee to disagreeth with the previous statement i judgeth their reaction solely bas'd on the exsufflicate space in the photographeth of an artificial objecteth setteth to 'rbit a planet
the frozen dihydrogen monoxide yond we participateth in a recreational activity on top of is wearing hence, reducing its width the previously mention'd dihydrogen monoxide is gaining a most wondrous temp'rature, subsequently, i adviseth thee to maketh the most wondrous of t and participateth in a recreational activity the univ'rse in which i existeth is rapidly gaining heateth, thus resulting in the destruction of c'rtain mat'rials. Is this, by chance, eke happening to anyone else? despite the dang'r of mine own current situation, i enjoyeth partaking in this nonce and mine own dopamine levels art not decreasing

a fellow human being once did question me on the subject of wheth'r 'r not i couldst giveth those folk a bawbling amount of currency so those gents couldst purchaseth fuel those gents toldeth me yond those gents did need to leaveth the vicinity i utt'r'd a casual f'rm of aye and wast did shock by the m're idea t wast possible yond i might beest in needeth of the fuel yond those gents w're purchasing in addition, ev'ry homo sapien on the planet is in needeth of a bawbling amount of currency
