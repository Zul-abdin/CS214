To test our file we used combinations of the following scenarios (in individual files as well as in directories):
	Empty Directories
	Empty Files
	Attempting to compress or decompress without codebook
	Attempting to use files recursively
	Attempting to use a directory non-recursively
	Attempting to use a path that does not exist
	Running compression twice to check if .hcz files are re-compressed
	Tokens larger than 100 characters
	Tokens larger than 1000 characters
	Tokens of size between 1 and 100
	Tokens of size 1
	Files with one token
	Files with over 100 tokens
	Files with over 1000 tokens
	Files with only escape characters
	Files with escape characters and other tokens
	Files with possible escape sequences created by the program; ex: $&*#, $, $**#
	Files with various extensions (.txt, .c, etc.) and files with no extensions
	Directories with nothing but a directory inside
	Files and Folders named "hcz"
	Files with all ASCII characters
	Files with non-ASCII characters
