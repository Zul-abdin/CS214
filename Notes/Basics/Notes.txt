How code is made into an executable:

Preprocessor -> Compile -> Linking -> Assembly

Preprocessor: Resolves your header files.
Compile: Compiles your code, but not stuff that is called from a library
Linking: Links code used from libraries that you just reference
Assembly: Code is turned into assembly and made into an executable
